        <h4>Pumola</h4>
        <p> The Pomola track follows the river down below Phajoding. The start point is above the Takin Reserve, <br>
            at a small tea shop. It winds through blue pine forest, with varying plant and animal life, including  <br>
            the famous rhododendron. Sometimes the horses from the Druk Path use this track. Let them pass or they might <br>
             push you off. This is a yak herding path and you will come across a number of grazing fields. Sometimes the path is <br>
              trampled to mush by the beast traffic, but the plus of this is that this action creates a clear trail. <br>
            There’s a clearing with a large ‘picnic’ rock in the middle just after the trail rejoins the creek. It’s a  <br>
            good place for a lunch or a snack break. Cross the creek and head to the left, following the path. It splits  <br>
            and rejoins frequently so it doesn’t matter which route you take. If you lose the path when it crosses a meadow,  <br>
            just keep heading up and you should be able to find it again. <br>
            Once you reach the Pomola Pass, denoted by a chorten, there are a  <br>
            number of options, each of which will take you to a different end point. <br>
            To the right is the gompa and the path that joins the Phajoding track; the track straight ahead will take you to Paro, <br>
            parallel to the Druk Path (some horsemen take this track back to Paro in a day after supporting groups on The Path – it is <br>
             not recommended to try this without a guide); the path to the left will take you back to Thimphu Buddha Point. <br>
              Whichever path you choose, ensure you have enough time.

        <h5>Wangdi Tse</h5>
        <p>Druk Wangditse Lhakhang("Temple of the Peak of Conquest"),(འབྲུག་དབང་འདུས་རྩེ་ལྷ་ཁང་) is located high on a forested ridge to<br>
            the south of Tashichho Dzong and overlooks the whole Thimphu valley. It was established in 1715 as the seat of the 8th Druk Desi, Druk Rabgye.<br>
            Druk Wangditse Lhakhang is one of the oldest temples in Thimphu, and considered an important heritage site of Bhutan. As it is located only <br>
            a 40-minute walk from Sangaygang in Thimphu, it is also a popular local picnic spot and visitor attraction.<br>
            During the 2011 Himalayan earthquake, the original temple suffered extensive damage, but it has since been rebuilt, <br>
            using a drawing of the earlier temple by Samuel Davis, who visited Bhutan in 1783, as well as archaeological findings, as a guide.<br>
            On January 24 to February 5, 2020, it was re-consecrated in a ceremony led by the Laytshog Lopon, Sangay Dorji, of the Zhung Dratshang.<br>
            The restored temple still contains the original large gilt copper image of Shakyamuni Buddha, flanked by the bodhisattvas Mañjuśrī and Avalokiteśvara.<br>
            On each of the two side walls are four large stupas together representing the eight great stupas (Chöten Deshey-gyed).[3][2] On the second floor is<br>
            a temple with murals depicting the deities of the mandalas of Hayagriva and Vajrakilaya , as well as figures of Indian Mahasiddhas and successive lamas of<br>
            the Bhutanese Drukpa Kagyu tradition At the rear of that floor there is a closed dharmapāla chapel dedicated<br>
            to Yeshe Gonpo (Chaturbhuja Mahakala) which also contains images of Shri Devi (Palden Lhamo Dudsolma) and Tsheringma as well as protectors of the 20 Dzonkhags.
